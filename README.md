Here you will find a selection of example scripts and  data used in the Collective behaviour field course at KRC.
You can use the provided matherials for:
1. Performing  basic quality checks on your bioacoustic data , generating spectrogram visualisations and running basic spectral analysis (See PAM folder)
2.  Using camera trap data to assess daily activity patterns
3.  Assessing daily activity patterns using accelerometer data
4.  TO ADD: Spatial and movement data (in progress)
5.  Install the packages for all scripts and load them all in one go 
6.  Generating random groups from a list of names/items

All scripts are provided without any guarantees! Use them with caution and make sure to read the comments. Everything works well with the provided example data 
but do not assume it will run seamlesly on your own data. For any questions feel free to get in touch. New scripts will be added slowly but surely :)
